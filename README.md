NextPVR-Plex
============

Plex Channel for viewing NextPVR content.  Has the ability to stream live TV in any tuner supported by http://nextpvr.com (which is almost any BDA enabled tuner).

The Plex channel has it's own log in Plex Media Server\Logs\PMS Plugin Logs\com.plexapp.agents.nextpvr.log.  This will normally be needed for any issues.

3 Options for viewing your channels in Plex:
Live - Lists channels and the current show - requires a working EPG (in nextpvr)
Channel List - Using a named channel group (defined in nextpvr) to list channels and ignoring the EPG.  Useful for a Hauppauge Colossus.
Channel Group List - lists all the channel groups and the channels for each.
Whats New - New recordings
